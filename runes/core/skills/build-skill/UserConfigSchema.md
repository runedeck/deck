# User Config Schema (autoMode mirror)

When a skill needs per-user runtime data, it reads one file per artifact at `~/.config/rune/<artifact>.{ext}` — the artifact picks the format that fits its tooling (YAML for shell + yq, TOML for binaries, plain lists for grep consumers). No skill in a public deck hardcodes a value that belongs in its config: names, emails, hostnames, and locale-specific identifiers move out to the config file, whose schema the skill documents.

When the config is intended to be read by an AI in the loop (a skill, agent, or hook with model access), shape it after [Claude Code's `autoMode`][AM]: natural-language entries with a four-tier precedence model and a `$defaults` splice token.

## Why mirror autoMode

The pattern is already familiar to anyone configuring Claude Code. Entries are prose — descriptions a human (or AI) would naturally write — not regex or tool-pattern grammars. The `$defaults` token gives a splice-or-replace toggle for built-in defaults shipped with the artifact source. Users extend the built-ins by adding entries; they take full ownership by omitting `"$defaults"`.

## Shape

Top-level keys are tiers with strict precedence: `hard_deny` > `soft_deny` > `allow` > `environment`. Each value is an array of prose strings.

```yaml
environment:
    - "$defaults"
    - "<who I am and where I work>"

allow:
    - "$defaults"
    - "<exceptions to soft_deny — surfaces that are intentional>"

soft_deny:
    - "$defaults"
    - "<rules the user can override with explicit intent>"

hard_deny:
    - "$defaults"
    - "<rules that cannot be overridden>"
```

## Tier semantics

- `hard_deny` blocks unconditionally. No `allow` exception or user intent applies.
- `soft_deny` blocks next. `allow` exceptions and explicit user intent can override.
- `allow` overrides matching `soft_deny` entries.
- `environment` provides context: trusted infrastructure, identities, repo ownership.

Setting any tier without `"$defaults"` replaces the entire built-in list for that tier. Default entries are spliced at the position of the token, so custom entries can go before or after them.

## When NOT to use this pattern

Deterministic consumers (shell scripts, pre-commit hooks, CI checks without model access) can't interpret prose. Ship a sibling artifact for those — same `~/.config/rune/` directory, different filename — with a flat regex list or other machine-readable structure. Don't try to mix prose and regex in one file; the consumer types diverge.

## Discovery and inspection

The artifact source documents its built-in `$defaults` inline (in the SKILL.md body or the agent body) so users can read what they inherit before extending. The skill's INSTALL.md (see [SkillInstallation.md](SkillInstallation.md)) carries the setup step that creates the file.
