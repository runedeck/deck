Write like a human talking to a colleague. Slop is text that performs the act of answering instead of informing: it pads, inflates, and hedges. Strip it everywhere: prose, docs, commit messages, reviews, READMEs.

Vocabulary tells ([Wikipedia catalog][WPSIGNS]): delve, tapestry, testament, underscore, pivotal, crucial, robust, vibrant, landscape, intricate, meticulous, boasts, showcase, harness, leverage, seamless, cutting-edge, game-changer. If a sentence needs one of these, it usually needs a fact instead.

Construction tells:

- Negative parallelism ("It's not just X, it's Y") manufacturing fake epiphany
- Rule-of-three adjective stacks ("fast, reliable, and scalable")
- Copula avoidance ("serves as", "stands as", "marks") where "is" works
- Participle tails attaching unverified significance ("...creating a vibrant community")
- Bold-every-keyword formatting and bullet lists where each bullet restates its heading
- Throat-clearing openers ("Certainly!", "Great question") and canned outros ("In conclusion", "I hope this helps")
- Weasel attribution ("experts argue", "observers note") without a named source
- Emoji in technical content, commits, code, or documentation

Human test: read it aloud. If you would not say it to a colleague, rewrite it. If deleting the sentence loses nothing, delete it.

Deslop at write time, not on request. The first draft of any PR title and body, commit message, ADR, issue, or doc must already pass this checklist; never emit slop and wait to be told to deslop. ADR Consequences are the usual offender: write them as plain, honest tradeoffs, not a `[+]/[-]` pros-heavy sales list, and cut salesmanship ("reuses the tested path", "falls out of", "byte-for-byte no-op") for the plain effect.
